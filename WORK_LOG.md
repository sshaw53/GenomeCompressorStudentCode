| Nov 13 | 10:10-10:40pm | I learned about the padding that is added by the zero to get a full byte of data, so to get around the padded zeros that were giving me an extra A, I added the number of characters at the beginning of the string so that I would only traverse through the length of characters and avoid the added characters of the String. |
