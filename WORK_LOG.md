| Nov 13 | 10:10-10:40pm | I learned about the padding that is added by the zero to get a full byte of data, so to get around the padded zeros that were giving me an extra A, I added the number of characters at the beginning of the string so that I would only traverse through the length of characters and avoid the added characters of the String. |
| Nov 14 |  9:20-9:40am  |                                                           Realized I couldn't use 31 bits to express the length of the file because Sedgewick's BinaryStdOut.write(int x, int r) function does not allow for me to use 31 bits because it could express a negative number, so I changed the length to be represented in 32 bits. |
